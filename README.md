This project demonstrates the implementation of a Machine Learning model using the Scikit-learn library. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify or predict outcomes from a dataset. Machine learning enables systems to learn patterns from data, make intelligent decisions, and improve performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
